#### sugar-free co-creation

### Dependencies
Snackis requires a ```C++1z``` capable compiler/standard library to build, and defaults to using ```clang``` with ```libc++```; it further depends on ```libcurl```, ```libsodium``` and ```libuuid``` for core functionality, as well as ```libcurses``` and ```libform``` for the UI. All dependencies are statically linked into the provided [Linux/64-binaries](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis/tree/master/dist).
